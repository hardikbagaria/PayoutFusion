## Overview

Payout Fusion is designed to simplify business billing operations by automating the entire invoice lifecycle, from creation to payment collection. The system generates tax-compliant PDF invoices, complete with calculated values such as GST and transportation costs. Payments can be collected using auto-generated UPI QR codes embedded in the invoice. Businesses can track party-wise transaction details, including ledgers, and send invoices via WhatsApp or email with just a few clicks.

This project also enables dynamic management of parties, bills, and items, providing a structured, reliable, and automated system to reduce the chances of human error.

## Features

- **Automated PDF Invoices**: Generates detailed, tax-compliant invoices with itemized lists and calculated totals (including tax, transportation, and discounts).
  
- **Dynamic Bill Calculations**: Automatically calculates totals for each invoice, including:
  - Total Taxable Value
  - GST @ 18%
  - Transportation Cost
  - Grand Total
  
- **Party Management**: Add, update, and delete party details. Information like address, GST number, and contact details are dynamically fetched from the database and displayed in the UI.

## System Architecture

Payout Fusion consists of a Java-based desktop application connected to a MySQL database. Invoices are generated as PDF files using the iText 7 library, and payments are facilitated via UPI QR codes. Data such as party details, bills, and items are stored in MySQL and retrieved via Java backend processes. The application also integrates with WhatsApp Web to automate invoice delivery using Selenium.

**Components**:
- **Frontend**: Java Swing for GUI.
- **Backend**: Java with integrated business logic for managing party and bill operations.
- **Database**: MySQL and Amazon AWS.
- **PDF Generation**: iText 7 Core.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Selenium for automating PDF delivery.

## Detailed Modules

### 1. Bill Management

This module handles the creation, updating, deletion, and viewing of bills. Bills are created with detailed itemized lists and dynamically calculated totals, including tax and transportation costs.

- **Table Structure**: The `BillsTable` consists of the following columns:
  - `BillNo`: Unique identifier for each bill.
  - `PartyName`: The name of the party the bill is associated with.
  - `Date`: The date the bill was created.
  - `VehicleDetails`: Any transportation-related details.
  - `Transportation`: Transportation costs.
  
- **Items Management**: Each bill contains multiple items, with columns for:
  - `ItemName`
  - `Quantity`
  - `Rate`
  - `Amount`

The amount for each item is calculated dynamically based on the entered quantity and rate.

### 2. Party Management

The Party Management module enables the user to add, update, delete, and view party details. Party information is stored in a MySQL database and includes fields like:
- `PartyName`
- `Address1`, `Address2`, `Address3`
- `GST Number`
- `Contact Person`
- `Phone Number`
- `Destination`

Validation is enforced for the GST number (alphanumeric, uppercase) and phone number (numeric).

### 3. Payment Integration

This module generates UPI QR codes dynamically within each PDF invoice. The QR code enables seamless payment collection when the customer scans the code using any UPI app.

The QR code is auto-scaled and inserted into a designated cell in the PDF, with dimensions that span multiple rows and columns to ensure visibility.

### 4. Ledger Management

The Ledger Management module allows businesses to view the transaction history for a selected party over a custom date range. The ledger displays:
- `Date`
- `Bill Number`
- `Amount`
- `Balance`

Ledger data is fetched in real-time from the database, and party details are dynamically populated from a dropdown list.

### 5. Automated Delivery

With integrated WhatsApp and email functionality, businesses can send invoices to customers with a single click. This module automates the sending process using Selenium for WhatsApp Web.

## Additional Features

### 1. Automatic Numeric to Word Conversion (in Bill Generation)

The **billGenGST** module includes functionality to convert the total invoice amount from numbers to words, ensuring the invoice is professional and compliant with business norms. For example, an invoice total of `â‚¹1234.56` is automatically converted to `One Thousand Two Hundred Thirty-Four Rupees and Fifty-Six Paise` and displayed on the invoice.

This feature eliminates manual effort and ensures consistency across all invoices.

### 2. Number-only Text Fields for `Amount` and `Rate`

To avoid incorrect data entry, the `Amount` and `Rate` fields in the itemized list of the invoice are restricted to numeric input only. These fields use custom `JTextField` components that validate input in real time, ensuring only numerical values are entered.

If non-numeric values are attempted, the field blocks the input, providing a smooth and error-free user experience.
